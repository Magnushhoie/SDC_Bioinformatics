    "Data wrangling, visualisation and basic statistics have become one of the staples in every day researchers life. It doesn't matter whether your field of interest is chemistry, biology, immunology or bioinformatics, it is of utmost importance that you are able to present the results of your analysis in a clear and concise way. Furthermore, it is paramount that you are able to choose the best analysis to answer your scientific question. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, today we will go over\n",
    "1. manipulating data with pandas\n",
    "2. visualisation techniques available in python \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this day you should be able to:\n",
    "1. import and manipulate your data effortlesly within the pandas software library \n",
    "2. confidently choose the best way to visualise your data \n",
    "3. make your desired graph with little effort \n",

    "\n",
    "We will go over two datasets in order to fullfil our goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset stored in \"aa_frequency_location.tsv\" has information on the N-terminus of proteins. The dataset cosists of two classes Secretory and Non-secretory proteins. The input consists of 20 features, which are the amino acid frequencies of the first 30 amino acids of a protein (N-terminal part). Our main question is whether or not we can see any differnces in amino acid usage between secretory and non secretory proteins and how can we use this to classify the proteins. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is stored in \"tissue_expression.tsv\". It contains gene expression levels for 189 samples and 7 tissues. \n",
