    "\n",
    "This workshop is conducted by ***Milena VujoviÄ‡$^{1}$***,  ***Frederikke Isa Marin$^{1}$*** and ***Anna-lisa Schaap-Johansen$^{1}$***. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have already gone through some data wrangling, visualisation,clustering and regression techniques, as well as looking up documentation. Therefore, today's exercise will be more independent and you are expected to look at  notebooks that you've worked on before for reminding yourself how to do certain steps if you don't remember e.g. loading the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will go over K nearest neighbours algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this day you should be able to:\n",
    "1. analyse your data using KNN clustering \n",
    "2. confidently plot the results of your analysis\n",
    "3. Assess your KNN clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go over two datasets in order to fullfil our goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset stored in \"aa_frequency_location.tsv\" has information on the N-terminus of proteins. The dataset cosists of two classes Secretory and Non-secretory proteins. The input consists of 20 features, which are the amino acid frequencies of the first 30 amino acids of a protein (N-terminal part). Our main question is whether or not we can see any differnces in amino acid usage between secretory and non secretory proteins and how can we use this to classify the proteins. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is stored in \"tissue_expression.tsv\". It contains gene expression levels for 189 samples and 7 tissues. \n",
